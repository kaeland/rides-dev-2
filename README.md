# The Rides App 

**Rides**, as it is currently called, is a simple featured mobile app for connecting students who are looking for rides to church. Students who frequently attend church are often in need of figuring out how they'll get from school, to a local church service, and then back to school again. Typically, a group of students without a means for transportation will coordinate with another student who is willing to drive the group to church, or vice versa. Coordinating these rides to a church service can sometimes be a bit of a nuisance due to the changing availability of students who have vehicles. 

A potential solution to this small inconvenience would be the use of a mobile application that takes away some of the tediousness of having to coordinate a ride to and from a local church on a weekly basis throughout the school year. Having searched through the IOS app store, there weren't any apps that **exactly** solved the concerns stated above.

And so the ideation/creation of **Rides**!!

## Development

Thinking of a way to help some of your classmates is one thing, but actually doing so presents an entirely new set of challenges. 

With little to no background in developing mobile applications, and applications in general, figuring out the best way to build this application has been somewhat of a journey. From choosing what programming language should be used, to securing the learning resouces to begin building the idea, it's safe to say that the struggle was "real" for this novice dev. 

With a bit of research and quite a few Udemy tutorials, the following tools are being used in building **Rides**: 
1. [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native)
2. [Redux](https://redux.js.org)
3. [Expo.io (Expo Client & Expo XDE)](https://expo.io)
4. [Atom (now using Visual Studio Code)](https://atom.io)
5. [Google Firebase (Realtime Database)](https://firebase.google.com/)
6. [Coolors](https://coolors.co)

## Goals
1. Complete a login feature
2. Request user details including: 
  * First & Last name
  * Church attended
3. Testing with Jest
4. User testing through the Expo.io Publishing feature
5. Submission to the IOS App Store
